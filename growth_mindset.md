# Growth Mindset
* What have you learned on your own? 1:1 for 1min each
* What did it make it possible? How did you do that?
* What do you think it helps people to unfold their potential? (15 min discussion in 5ppl groups)
    * Write down on a board
* Videos from Carol Dweck
* Video neuroplasticity
* You cannot be always in growth mindset, you need to be in your comfort zone (fixed mindset) as well.
* _Have you heard something from your partner that is worth sharing?_

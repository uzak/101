    * Catch others doing something well!
* Rule 2: On behaviour

    * Everybody is speaking about himself, about his perceptions
    * Prepare in advance. Don't immediately react.
    * 1:1, not in a group.
    * When giving negative feedback: be to the point, specific and SHORT. Like an operation. 
    * Ask if giving negative feedback is OK?
    * Sandwich: after negative feedback the positive might not be heard at all.

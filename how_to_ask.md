# Implementation
## Intro (15min)
* Introduce the motivation and time frames
* Initial status check
    * Who had participated in a consultation session?
    * Who had asked a question during schoolwork?
    * Who had asked a question online on discord?
* Form pairs and ask (1-1 minute) questions:
    * Find an occasion when you needed help and couldn't get help
    * Find an occasion when you needed help and you received it!
    * Did you have some interesting failures / successes?

## Game (30min)
* Ask a participant to draw a picture. Another instructs him and only this person sees what to draw. Others draw on a piece of paper.
* 1st round: no questions
* 2nd round: with questions
    * flip pages and start over
    * the same participant as in the 1st round instructs others
* Debriefing:
    * Ask participants to show both drawings and show the original
    * Ask participants:
        * What was different in the two rounds?
        * What type of questions did help you to draw the picture?
* Summary
    * Summarize answers from debriefing
    * Explain: 
        * it needs a lot of empathy to explain complex things
        * you need to ask questions to get the most out of the conversation
        * 
## Steps of problem solving (20min)
* Ask participants to write down the steps they do when stuck with a problem during their studies
    * first they do it alone (2 min)
    * next form pairs (4 min)
    * finally form groups of 4 and share the ideas they came up with on flipchart/whiteboard (8min)
* Ask one spokesperson from each group briefly shares the result
* Ask questions:
    * Why would you do it in that order?
    * How much time would you wait to go from one step to another
    * Is there a difference between synchronous (e.g. in person) and asynchronous asking (e.g. discord)?

## Closing (5 min)
* Ask participants to answer the following questions in a written form, only for themselves
    * What will you do differently because of this workshop?
    * How will it affect you that you do that thing differently?
* Ask students to put post-its on your laptop/desk regarding what went well and what needs to be modified.

# JavaScript: Procedural Programming 101

## Prerequisites

* Install `node` and `npm`
* Be able to access your browser's developer tools

## Fundamentals

### Syntax and Semantics

* Gramar. Computer is a gramar nazi.
* Computer doesn't think. Programmers (hopefully) do.

### Flow of execution
* Programmers direct the flow
* Computer starts at the top and works down to the bottom
* Programer's job is to manage the complexity. The tool to achieve that in procedural programming is functions and modules.

### Expressions, Statements, REPL

* Expression anything evaluated to produce a value.
* Statement does something without producing a value.
* REPL: read-eval-print loop
* [more](https://therenegadecoder.com/code/the-difference-between-statements-and-expressions/)

### CLI

* terminal/console
* GUI vs. CLI
* textual way of communicating with the computer
* powerful

## Variables

* labeled container
* naming super important. Qualification, scope, descriptive name.
* english only
* camel case
* let vs. var, const

## IO

* prompt()
* console.log()

## Data Types and Operators

* primitive vs. complex
* typeof

### String
* indexing (sequential data types)
* regular expressions

### Number
* For the computer everything is a number. That's why it is a computer. Only we give it a different meaning (data type) and representation.

### Boolean
### Array
### Object

### Set, Map

## Conditionals
* control the flow 
* if

## Loops
* DRY -> automatization
* while
* for, for of, for in
* break
* recursion
* iteration

## Functions
* Centerpiese of procedural programming
* Divide and conquer
* Procedure vs. function
* logic of a program
* [Builtin functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects#function_properties)
* namespace, universe on it's own
* blackbox

### Custom functions
* Magic, powerful words. Analogy: spell.
* Components: 
  1. name
  2. arguments (input)
  3. return value

## Comments
* The less the better
* Hints where factoring a function could be useful

## Error handling

## Modules

## Software Engineering

* KISS
* DRY
* Garbage in, garbage out
* Clean programming
* 80x24
* 0 -> great, 1 -> good, 2 -> OK, 3 and more -> too complex
* Bulgarian constants
